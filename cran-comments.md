I have read and agree to the the CRAN policies at
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install with R 3.2.3 and
R development version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and WinBuilder.

This is a new package.

R CHECK will likely suggest spelling changes for 'OAI-PMH' to 'Oai-PMH', but 
'OAI-PMH' is the correct form. 

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
