        National Data Service (ANDS)","description":"The Australian National Data
        Service (ANDS) makes Australia''s research data assets more valuable for researchers,
        research institutions and the nation.\n\nWe do this through working in trusted
        partnerships on research data projects, delivering reliable national services
        and enhancing the capability of Australia''s research data system.\n \nA key
        ANDS service is the [Research Data Australia](http://researchdata.ands.org.au/)
        discovery portal where you can find, access and reuse Australian research
        data.\n\nANDS is a partnership led by Monash University, in collaboration
        with the Australian National University and CSIRO. It is funded by the Australian
        Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy
        (NCRIS).\n \nANDS involvement in the DataCite consortium ensures that we are
        active in global initiatives addressing the issues surrounding research data,
        including those of publication, citation and standards. ANDS has run its [Cite
        My Data](http://ands.org.au/services/cite-my-data.html) service since 2011.
        This service allows Australian research organisations to assign DOIs to their
        own research collections. This, in turn, provides researchers with a means
        of citing their published data and achieving recognition for their research
        data output.\n \nSubscribe to our discussion list: [ANDS Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/ands-general).\n
